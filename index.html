                    <h2>It all began in Dawn: Dawn, MO</h2>
                    <p>
                      The little hamlet of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn,_Missouri">Dawn, Missouri</a> hosted my family from
                      before my birth to the age of 5. Although the town today boasts less than 150 people and no businesses to speak of, the Dawn of my youth hosted
                      two general stores, a diner, a gas station, a bank, a car mechanic and an excavator. My grandfather, a lifelong resident of the town, owned
                      Copple Feed and Seed, which in addition to selling its title products, provided bulk fuels and heavy equipment repair for the large number
                      of local farmers who resided around our town. Dawn was also home to Dawn Lodge No. 539, a Masonic Lodge which played a large part in my life
                      as a child and an adult.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      We lived in a tiny, two-bedroom home that my father purchased for $800 from my grandfather. It was the oldest building in town, said to have once
                      been the site of an establishment called "Friendly Tavern." Considering that most of the stories I heard about it ended with a fight or a raid by
                      government revenue agents during Prohibition, I suspect it wasn't nearly as "friendly" as the name suggested. Nevertheless, it provided a safe,
                      comfortable home. The house was on the crest of a steep ridge that sloped down to a stream behind our house which fed a local creek. The difference
                      in elevation between the front of the house and the deck in back was so great that the "crawl space" under the house was high enough for an adult
                      to walk, as long as he stooped slightly. There we kept my favorite object, an old claw-foot tub filled with earth and the earthworms (we called them
                      'night crawlers') that we used as bait on our regular fishing trips to Shoal Creek, which ran at the edge of town. I loved collecting earth worms
                      and depositing them in the tub, as well as digging through the tub to pull out and play with them. In fact, I must admit that I loved
                      playing with the worms much more than I enjoyed fishing with them; my father and grandfather were insistent that we must be absolutely quiet on the
                      creek bank when we fished, and not move -- two tasks that my child-self found nearly impossible to perform!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      My paternal grandparents lived just up the street from us. Their house was nearly as tiny as ours -- the main difference being a third bedroom that
                      my grandfather had added on to the house in the 1940's, after my father was born. However, the property itself had formerly been the site of a small
                      farmstead, providing my brothers and I with years of fun and excitement exploring an old barn, a chicken house, a smoke house, an outhouse
                      (which often came in handy during big family gatherings, with only one small bathroom!), and best of all, an old, abandoned home next door.
                      We were convinced the two-story Victorian structure was haunted, and we spent many a night exploring its rooms, hunting for the spirits we were certain
                      inhabited the place. We made up the most incredible tales of murder and mayhem, which we told in our grandparent's back yard around autumn bonfires,
                      with the old structure looming over us, black in the night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Even after we moved on (see the section on <a href="#utica">Utica Missouri</a>), Dawn continued to be an important part of my life. In Dawn, I found my
                      first crush there (an 'older woman' two classes ahead of me -- I crushed on her for an entire summer but never had the courage to verbalize it), stopped by
                      the remaining general store for sandwiches after football and track practice as a teenager, and spent countless summer days exploring its streets and
                      buildings while staying at my grandparents' home. Relatives of mine still live there today, and my parents are buried just a few miles away in a local
                      cemetery, beside four generations of Copples. No matter where I live or move in the future, a little piece of my heart will always be in Dawn, Missouri.

                    <h2>The One Horse Town: Growing Up in Utica, MO</h2>
                    <p>
                      Shortly before I began Kindergarten, my parents decided they wanted a bigger home and purchased a three-bedroom "cracker-box ranch" (so named because these
                      houses were shaped like a cracker box, a long rectangle of a house built along the axis of a central hallway) in the neighboring town of
                      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utica,_Missouri">Utica, Missouri</a>. Although slightly larger than Dawn, Utica was much closer to the county
                      seat of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chillicothe,_Missouri">Chillicothe</a>, so the town only boasted a single auto repair / blacksmith shop,
                      a post office and two churches, rather than the array of small businesses found in Dawn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I spent the rest of my childhood in sleepy little Utica. The primary feature of the town was our ballfield, which served as a gathering spot for local
                      kids, as well as the default neutral location for the occasional fight over a girl or to avenge some insult, imagined or real.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      My maternal grandmother lived in Utica, just down the street from our house. My first memory of Utica takes place shortly before we moved there.
                      My parents were visiting, along with my mother's sister and her husband. My grandmother mentioned that she thought that a well she recently had filled
                      and capped was settling, and she was concerned that a sinkhole might appear that would be dangerous to local kids. My father and uncle decided to go
                      outside and assess the situation. When I found it they had stepped outside, I decided I wanted to see the well, too. Before my mother could prohibit me,
                      I ran out the door and after my dad.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It was starting to get dark and I couldn't find my dad and uncle. So I started looking for them, and in the process, walked down a nearby street and
                      got lost. Thankfully, a kindly older couple found me wandering, immediately figured out who I was, and called my grandmother. I was only a block away
                      from grandma's house, but once my mother discovered my absence, and was unable to immediately see me, she jumped to the conclusion that something
                      awful must have happened to me. I can imagine her relief (and no doubt, a considerable amount of anger) when she found me drinking a bottle of RC Cola
                      and a bag of peanuts with the neighbors!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      It turns out, I was literally across the street from the house that would become my home until I married, some 17 years later. Mr. Jay Vandusing,the
                      kindly neighbor who gave me pop and peanuts while my mom had a panic attack, would never tire of telling that story. I had the privilege of telling
                      it myself, several years later, as a eulogy at his funeral.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Rural folk often get a bad rap nowadays, especially in our hyper-partisan political era. The people of Utica, Missouri, were like any other group
                      of people -- there were good folk, there were not-so-good folk. There were truth-tellers and there were liars, villians and heros. But overall, I
                      feel privileged to have grown up in this small, quiet village. As a teenager, struggling as all teens do with the tough work of growing up and finding
                      my identity, I spent a lot of nights walking on its gravel-covered streets, marveling at the stars (a privilege many who grow up in urban areas do not
                      readily get). Among my role models were the local blacksmith, who would forget to charge customers for services rendered if they were unemployed or going
                      through a financial crisis; the pastor of one of the local Baptist churches, who always got presents for all of the kids in the church, even though
                      he barely made enough to feed his own family; and my youth group leader, a veteran of the Korean War who taught me to lead while he taught all of us
                      how to distinguish trees by their leaves and find direction without a compass. I must admit to having forgotten nearly every lesson he taught about
                      nature, but his lessons in leadership inspire me today.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      During my senior year in high school, I became part of a fraternity that my father and grandfather were also members of: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemasonry">
                      Freemasonry</a>. Dawn and Utica both boasted small Masonic Lodges, and my family was active in the fraternity from long before I was born. I practically
                      grew up in the Masonic Lodge, taking part in chili suppers, local festivals, and listening to my dad practice his lines. My parents' and grandparents' homes
                      were filled with Masonic memorabilia, commemorating their achievements and celebrating their longevity in this great organization. All the role models
                      I mentioned earlier were part of this fraternity. Even though all the men in those Lodges are now dead or far away, I remain a proud Freemason today, attending
                      a Lodge in Kansas City.

                    <h3>Side Trip to "The 80": Lock Springs, Missouri</h3>
                    <p>
                      Any discussion of my life in Utica is incomplete without mentioning another spot where I spent countless days -- my maternal grandfather's farm
                      outside of Lock Springs, MO. It was literally four miles from our home, though it took much longer to get there by car because the Grand River flowed
                      between our two towns, requiring a long detour to a bridge. My brother and I, however, would simply walk there, fording the river behind Utica, climbing
                      the bank, and then drying out as we walked through farm fields and along country lanes to the 80 acres we all thought of as our second home.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The "farm" consisted of a one-room, cinderblock cabin and a small pond with a boat dock, surrounded by woods. We would spend summer weekends there, splashing in the pond,
                      fishing, and romping through the woods pretending to be explorers. It was an idyllic spot, with no television to distract us from the business of
                      relaxing in nature.

                    <h2>Playing in the World's Largest Sandbox: Service in Saudi Arabia</h2>
                    <p>
                      Among my many adventures in life was a single term of enlistment with the United States Army Reserve. I joined the USAR at 17, practically begging for
                      my mother and father to give their permission. I was intoxicated by the idea of military service; I grew up during the Cold War, and always expected that
                      sooner or later, war would break out with what was then known as the Soviet Union. I felt the highest honor that could befall any red-blooded American male
                      was to fight for his country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      As a college sophomore at <a href="http://missouri.edu/">Mizzou</a>, I got my chance to put my belief into practice. Just after Thanksgiving of 1990, my unit,
                      the <a href="https://history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/ag/0795agco.htm">795th Adjutant General Company, United States Army Reserve</a>, was
                      mobilized to support Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. In December, we deployed to Saudi Arabia.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      For a land with almost nothing but sand, Saudi Arabia is quite beautiful. One of the most significant events of my life happened there. During a redeployment
                      to support the upcoming invasion of Iraq (the famous "Left Hook" of General Norman Schwartzkopf), I had a few moments to stand in the desert night under
                      complete blackout conditions. Having grown up in a rural town, I was used to being able to see the night sky; however, I had never seen it like this. For the
                      first time in my life, I saw the milky way as our pre-electric ancestors did, for a full 360 degrees around me. For a moment, I lost my sense of self, and
                      felt like I was simply melting into the universe. To this day, when I feel lonely, sad, or angry, I call up that vision to remind me that in the end, I am
                      just a very small part of a very large universe, and suddenly, the problem doesn't seem quite so important anymore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      I returned back to Utica upon completion of my service, and thence to the University of Missouri, where I met the incredible person who would later become
                      my wife.

                    <h2>Adulting in Columbia: Columbia, MO</h2>
                    <p>
                    Shortly after returning to civilian life in 1991, I began dating a remarkable young woman by the name of Tamara Copple. Two years later, in 1993, we were
                    married in her hometown of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moberly,_Missouri">Moberly, Missouri</a> and set up a household in Columbia, where she
                    finished up her baccaleuareate degree and I looked for full-time work.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    We stayed in Columbia for five years. Columbia is a great place to be young and newlywed;
                    rent was cheap, apartments were abundant and the cost of living was moderate. The MKT ("Katy") Trail, Shelter Insurance Gardens, an abundance of parks and trails,
                    and a downtown that was built around college-age kids made for a fun few years as we both explored what it meant to be a married couple. Columbia Mall provided
                    paychecks as we got started, and entertainment after we established ourselves.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, I could not decide what I wanted to be when I grew up. In the beginning, I worked retail; later, I worked as an administative assistant and eventually,
                    landed myself a position at a local insurance company. However, none of these careers interested me as long-term propositions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    While there, I began using Lotus 1-2-3 to track some of the work I was doing for my team. My mother, a bank executive, had taught me to program using the Lotus
                    Symphony package when I was a teenager (she needed a "study buddy" to help her learn, and I had already learned programming while playing around with our
                    home computer). At the insurance company, I put those skills to work tracking underwriting audits for the team of underwriters I supported. I discovered that
                    I really enjoyed programming, and just as importantly, that I was good at it. The kudos quickly piled up, and soon I was teaching other admins to program.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I had never considered programming as a career before, primarily because computer
                    science in the late 80's and 90's was a math degree with some programming theory thrown in (I didn't even know of the existence of MIS degrees), and I hated math
                    passionately. There was no way I was going to suffer through three semesters of calculus! I started to think about it now, however. I never felt happier than
                    when I was programming.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    An underwriter in my team mentioned my work to her husband, who happened to be a supervisor in the insurance company's information technology department.
                    We had a great discussion, and after seeing my code (and hearing me explain it, as he had never actually seen a spreadsheet, let alone used one -- he was
                    a mainframe programmer), he asked me to take an aptitude exam.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I passed the exam with flying colors, astonishing the proctor, who was used to experienced programmers doing badly on it at times. However, my hopes of
                    a career as a programmer were dashed quickly, when the human resources department informed me that a computer science degree, or five years of equivalent
                    experience, was required.

                    <h2>Layover in Leavenworth: Leavenworth, KS</h2>
                    <p>
                      At last, I had discovered what I wanted to do with my life. I wanted to be in information technology! I decided to go back to college (I dropped out
                      shortly before marrying) and get a computer science education. Unfortunately, we could not afford for me to leave work to go to school during the day,
                      and the schools in the Columbia area did not offer computer science courses at night.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Several schools in the Kansas City area did, however, so we decided to move west. Friends of ours already lived in Leavenworth, and offered to share
                      a house with my wife and I while we got on our feet. Although we were understandably nervous, we decided to relocate. We quit our jobs, withdrew money
                      from our profit-sharing and retirement accounts to pay off our debts, and moved into a large mansion in Leavenworth, KS with three other couples. We were
                      given a bedroom and a small parlor to call our own. After years of living alone in large apartments, it was a really big change. We managed to last
                      about five months before we'd had enough. Lucky for us, the landlords sold the house right about the time we wanted to leave, and ended the lease.

                      After our brief sojourn in Leavenworth, we moved to Kansas City.

                    <h2>Adventures in Historic Home Ownership: Kansas City, MO</h2>
                    <p>
                      We stayed in apartments for a year and a half or so before getting ourselves settled into permanent jobs, at which time we decided it was
                      time to buy a house. We bought a beautiful little craftsman-era shirtwaist in Kansas City's Historic Northeast, on 8th street.

                      We spent ten great years in our century-old home. It was my son's first home, where he went from toddler to pre-schooler to elementary student.
                      The house had a large front porch. One of my favorite things to do was to sit on the porch and watch people walk by, talking to my neighbors on both
                      sides who were on their porches. We never knew who might walk by, walking their dog or taking a stroll. The street was lined with mature trees and
                      we were minutes away from every major highway. We were within walking distance of Kansas City landmarks such as the Kansas City Museum and the Concourse.

                      Unfortunately, the market crash of 2008 hurt the neighborhood badly. What had once been a street filled with owner-occupied homes became a roadway
                      lined by homes abandoned by foreclosure or turned into cheap rentals as our neighbors lost their jobs and their income. Crime began creeping up and
                      we began taking our now-elementary-school-aged son to a private school in the northland, because the local school district was in disarray. After ten
                      years, we felt it was time to get him -- and us -- into a better neighborhood.

                    <p>
                      Unable to sell the home, we proceeded to rent it for the last several years. This year, our little urban neighborhood went from "not" to "hot" as
                      newly prosperous millennials start looking for affordable first homes within easy reach of downtown. We finally sold it in November of 2017, closing
                      a long and memorable chapter of our lives.

                    <h2>Suburban Style: Gladstone, MO</h2>
                    <p>
                      We currently live in a beautiful tudor-style home in suburban Gladstone, Missouri. Our son lives close to his friends and goes to a great Clay County
                      school. We have access to all the amenities of a large metropolitan area, while also being able to live a small-town lifestyle. We love the quiet streets,
                      our large yard, and the privacy of our deck.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      This probably won't be our last home. Our son is off to college soon, and once he goes, this four-bedroom house is going to feel like a palace for two
                      middle-aged empty-nesters. We are already talking about where we might find a small, maintenance-free condo or house somewhere in the metro -- or perhaps
                      even in another metro, such as Denver, Austin or the east coast. We'll see what the future holds!
